  the scientific problem of software portability can be summarized in the following sentence:
  "we don't know exactly how to achieve a high degree of portability but here is our experience
  on how to do it for our specific project. we also try to formalize the process but there
  is still much work to do"
  it seems to me that this is a very hard problem and the situation may be that we cannot even
  achieve a solution. when i say solution i have in mind an algorithmic approach to the problem,
  a cookbook step-by-step solution.
