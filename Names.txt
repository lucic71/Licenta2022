PortableIM
Portable(Network|Protocol|ControlPlane)TestingInfrastructure (P(N|P|CP)TI) - because what we provide is a portable infrastructure for testing protocols
ProtocolTesterPi - PTPi
CPlaneTester
MediaLayerTester - because the lowest 3 layers in OSI stack are called Media Layer

For a proper name read the abstract and summarize it in a sentence.

Porting IxOS (legacy?) testing infrastructure on ARM devices
Bringing portability to IxOS testing infrastructure (this sounds like a proper name for stock kernel)
System portability on Ixia infrastructure: a case study from ??? to ARM hardware (this title suggests we discuss the scientific problem of software portability using a technical study of porting Ixia software)
Experience with porting Ixia's testing infrastructure on ARM devices (not bad, not good)
An overview of software portability: porting IxOS testing infrastructure on ARM devices (a bit too much?)
