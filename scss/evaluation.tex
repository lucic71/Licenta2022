\section{Porting Costs Evaluation}

% What I want to say in this section:
%   - I want to take the model of Tanaka and map my timeline on it (maybe merge
%   the model with [1])
%   - I want to talk about the porting tasks
%     - which was most time consuming
%     - which of them were repetitive and added little value
%     - etc
%   - I want to talk about the human and development factors as described in [1]
%   - talk about environment disparity and program factors; and how did this
%   affect the costs
%   - Finally I need to understand the equations for porting costs evaluation
%   and estimation in order to compare the resluts (and maybe talk about the
%   porting productivity index)
%
% The Tanaka+Hakuta model mapped on our timeline will be presented in a table.
% The indices from Hakuta([1]) will be presented in different subsection (idk).

In this section we present the costs associated with the porting process
described in the previous section. First we divide our work in tasks that can
be individually evaluated and later we discuss the factors that affected our
cost evaluation.

\subsection{Man-days costs}

In order to have an accurate cost evaluation of the porting process, we divided
our process into multiple subprocesses that can easily be evaluated using the
tracking created during the porting. We use man-days to evaluate the
cost for each subprocess because the tracking was done each week rather than
each day.

The anatomy of the porting process, as described in Tanaka et al. (citation
needed here) and Hakuta et al. (citation needed, there are only two authors,
should I name both instead saying "et al."?) with modification as per our
project needs has the following structure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Advance preparations
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Surveying development environment
            \item Surveying target OS
            \item Surveying program for porting
            \item Surveying documentation
            \item Adjusting development environment
            \item Adjusting target environment
            \item Initial source code modifications
        \end{itemize}
    \item Building for target environment
        \begin{itemize}
            \item File-making
            \item Installation on remote environment
            \item Reviewing inconsistencies between source and remote environments
            \item Solving problems with external dependencies
            \item Create testing infrastructure
        \end{itemize}
    \item Testing
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Testing in simulated environment
            \item Testing in target environment
        \end{itemize}
    \item General duties
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Documentation
            \item Progress tracking
            \item Discussions
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This structure assumes that porting is a linear process, which is not the case.
Many tasks are repetitive between different stages of the project. For example
file-making occurs before and after testing in target environment takes place,
making it hard to accurately track each subtask. For this reason table
~\ref{tab:manHoursEvaluation} does not track the exact hours or days spent
on a specific subtask. It rather presents in how many days a specific subtask
was finished, even if that subtask took one or two hours of that day. Finally,
the last column of the table presents the number of days to finish a subtask
relative to the total number of days.
