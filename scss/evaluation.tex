\section{Porting Costs Evaluation}

% What I want to say in this section:
%   - I want to take the model of Tanaka and map my timeline on it (maybe merge
%   the model with [1])
%   - I want to talk about the porting tasks
%     - which was most time consuming
%     - which of them were repetitive and added little value
%     - etc
%   - I want to talk about the human and development factors as described in [1]
%   - talk about environment disparity and program factors; and how did this
%   affect the costs
%   - Finally I need to understand the equations for porting costs evaluation
%   and estimation in order to compare the resluts (and maybe talk about the
%   porting productivity index)
%
% The Tanaka+Hakuta model mapped on our timeline will be presented in a table.
% The indices from Hakuta([1]) will be presented in different subsection (idk).
