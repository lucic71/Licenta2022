\section{Discussions on Porting Costs}

% What I want to say in this section:
%   - I want to reflect on imporving the porting process we did. Tanaka proposes
%   the following seven ways of raising porting efficiency:
%     - porting guidlines
%     - porting compatibility checking tool
%     - portability evaluation tool
%     - tool for generating system calling routines
%     - program structure viewing tool
%     - os emulator
%     - test support tools
%   - I would like to see how relevant are they for our project. there is no way
%   at the moment to actually test the ways of improving porting efficiency so
%   I will keep the statements at the level of discussion, thinking about how
%   would have the process been different if we used one of the above ways (this
%   is chapter 3.2 from Tanaka)
