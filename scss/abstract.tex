Software porting is costly and time consuming. As developers prefer to reuse
code instead of rewriting it, it is important to understand the framework for
quantifing the costs so that the process can be optimized based on these exact
costs. In this paper we port the Ixia network testing infrastructure on ARM
boards, such as Raspberry Pi, and extract the porting costs associated with this
process. By doing this we create a revised model of porting based on which we
extract the costs for our project. Furhtermore we present the factors that
affect the costs and their direct correspondence with the porting model and
costs. Finally, we discuss the problems in the field of software porting
processes and costs to highlight the limitations we met in our project and
others might meet in future projects.
