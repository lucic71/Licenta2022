# Project Structure:

- Intro
  + systems and software engineering -> software platfrms (portability problems) -> portability
  + software portability
  + abstract decomposition
  + the domain is not well explored (not in an academic way, the internet is full of people sharing porting experiences)
- Background
  + quantitative portability paper
  + portability layers (hw, system, application)
- Implementation
  + how did we port the IM? (the methodology)
  + what problems occured because the system was to complex?
- Experimental Evaluation [WIP]
  + how "easy" (??) was the porting process
  + comparative performance evaluation of the "before" and "after"?
- Discussion
  + what role does the documentation play in the porting process?
  + what role does the familiarity of the person working with the system play in the porting process?
